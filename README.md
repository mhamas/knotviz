# Knotviz

High-performance interactive graph visualization tool built with React, TypeScript, and **@cosmos.gl/graph** (GPU-accelerated WebGL). Handles graphs with **up to 4 million nodes** in the browser. Drop a JSON graph file, explore the network visually, run GPU force-directed simulations, filter and color nodes by properties, and export the result.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, then drag-and-drop a JSON graph file onto the drop zone (or click to browse).

## Performance and Capacity

### How big can your graph be?

Measured ceilings per format at a **4 GB heap** (typical Chrome tab), 1.5 edges per node, file generated from random ids:

| Format | Ceiling | File at ceiling | Parse time | Peak RSS | Limited by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| JSON | **~15M nodes** | ~3 GB | ~90s | ~600 MB + ~1 GB builder | streaming parser is fine past 24M; worker's `nodeIndexMap: Map<string, number>` hits the V8 cap at ~2²⁴ entries (~16.7M) |
| CSV edge list | **~15M nodes** | ~650 MB | ~30s | ~1.2 GB | streaming parser's `knownNodeIds: Set<string>` hits the same V8 cap |
| CSV nodes+edges pair | **~15M nodes** | ~1.3 GB | ~50s | ~1.4 GB | same V8 `Set` cap |
| GraphML | **~1M nodes** | ~240 MB | ~30s | OOM above | `fast-xml-parser` builds the full DOM in memory. Past ~1M it blows the 4 GB heap. |
| GEXF | **~1.5M nodes** | ~360 MB | ~40s | OOM above | same as GraphML |

Numbers were measured by `scripts/experiment-large-sizes.ts` — a probe-and-binary-search run at 4 GB heap with a 5-minute per-probe timeout. See `MANUAL_TESTING.md` and `large_size_experiment/results.md` for the raw per-probe log.

**Interaction tier** once loaded:

| Graph size | Load | Interaction |
|---|---|---|
| 10K | <1s | 60 FPS, instant everything |
| 100K | ~2s | 60 FPS |
| 1M | ~10s | 30+ FPS |
| 5M | ~30s | 15+ FPS, labels auto-sampled during simulation |
| 15M | ~50–90s | still interactive once loaded; search, filter, and color help find what you need |

**If you actually have >15M nodes** today: use JSON or CSV up to the ceiling, split the graph into subgraphs, or pre-filter before dropping in. Lifting the 15M cap cleanly would mean replacing the `Set`/`Map` node-dedup with a structure that scales past V8's 2²⁴ internal limit (roaring bitmap, flat-buffer sparse set, or a `{id → index}` plain object).

### The simulation-space ceiling (GPU-bound, varies by hardware)

The force-directed simulation runs on a bounded 2D grid, and the grid side length is bounded by your GPU's WebGL `MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE`. That number is **hardware-specific**:

| GPU tier | Typical MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE | Knotviz simulation side |
|---|---|---|
| Modern desktop / recent laptops | 16384+ | capped at 8192 (cosmos's internal upper bound) |
| Older discrete / integrated | 8192 | 8192 |
| Weak iGPUs, Chromebooks, some mobile | 4096 | 4096 |
| Very old / headless SwiftShader | 2048–4096 | whatever the GPU reports |

Cosmos auto-reduces `spaceSize` to what your GPU actually supports and logs a console warning if it had to drop below the requested size (`The spaceSize has been reduced to N due to WebGL limits`). If you're running on an older machine and hitting visual saturation earlier than you'd expect, check the console — you might be on a 4096 box.

Inside whatever square your GPU gives you, nodes can't spread indefinitely. Past a certain density the simulation keeps running correctly — the physics is still GPU-bound, not CPU-bound — but the *image* saturates:

| Graph size | What the canvas looks like at fit-view |
|---|---|
| ≤100k | Sparse, easy to trace individual connections |
| 100k–500k | Dense but clusters clearly separable |
| 500k–1M | Most of the square is covered; individual nodes start blurring into a "field of dots" |
| 1M+ | The simulation square is typically filled edge-to-edge. Community structure (clusters) is often still visible, but node-level detail requires zoom |

The exact crossover depends on your graph:
- **Strong community structure** — clusters clump, leaving empty space. Stays legible longer (often up to 2–3M nodes).
- **Uniform / random connectivity** — nodes spread evenly. Visual ceiling can hit as low as 500k.
- **Tree-like / sparse graphs** — can stay legible past 5M because they occupy less area per edge.

Past the visual ceiling, the graph is still fully interactive and filters/search/color mode work normally — you just can't read the big picture at full zoom. Zoom in, or use filter + search to narrow down to the subgraph you care about.

### Architecture

- **GPU rendering + simulation**: All rendering and force simulation run on the GPU via `@cosmos.gl/graph`. CPU does almost nothing during interaction.
- **Web Worker loading**: File parsing runs in a dedicated worker so the UI stays responsive with a progress indicator. JSON and CSV use streaming parsers for files ≥200 MB (never holds the full text in memory); smaller files use `JSON.parse` / full CSV read. GraphML and GEXF are always read in full (no SAX mode yet) — see the capacity table above.
- **Web Worker appearance pipeline**: Filter matching, gradient coloring, link visibility, and substring-search highlight are all computed in a separate worker. Main thread only posts filter/gradient/search config (~1 KB) and receives pre-built `Float32Array`s back (zero-copy transfer).
- **Compact data model**: Nodes stored as parallel arrays (`nodeIds[]`, `nodeLabels[]`) + columnar property arrays instead of full objects. ~80% less memory than `NodeInput[]`.
- **GPU shader uniforms**: Node size and edge size sliders change `pointSizeScale`/`linkWidthScale` shader uniforms — instant response, no data rebuild.
- **Cached hex-to-RGBA conversion**: Only ~20 unique colors exist in practice, but the conversion may be called millions of times. Results are cached.

### Tips for large graphs

- **Labels**: Auto-disabled during simulation for graphs >50K nodes (illegible at that scale and expensive to update).
- **Rotation**: Transforms actual node positions via rotation matrix around centre of mass — no CSS transform, canvas always fills the viewport.
- **Filters**: Filtered-out nodes are fully hidden (alpha=0, size=0), not just dimmed. Edges to hidden nodes are also hidden.
- **Search highlight**: Non-matching nodes are *dimmed* (alpha 0.1), not hidden — context stays visible. Filter visibility wins: filter-hidden nodes never reappear even if they match the search.
- **Export**: For very large graphs (>1M nodes), export creates a large JSON file. Consider disabling pretty-printing for smaller file size.

## Input Formats

Knotviz reads five file formats. All of them flow into the same internal graph model and downstream pipeline — use whichever is most convenient for your data source.

| Format | Extension | Drop | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| JSON | `.json` | single file | Native format, full fidelity, versioned schema |
| CSV edge list | `.csv` / `.tsv` | single file | Zero-config edge list, nodes auto-derived |
| CSV nodes+edges pair | `.csv` / `.tsv` × 2 | both files at once | Full per-node properties with typed headers |
| GraphML | `.graphml` / `.xml` | single file | W3C-ish standard; round-trips Gephi / NetworkX / yEd |
| GEXF | `.gexf` | single file | Gephi's native format, supports `viz:position` for x/y |

### Shared conventions

- **Property types**: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `date` (ISO 8601 string), and `string[]` (multi-valued).
- **String arrays are pipe-delimited** (`red|green|blue`). Literal `|` inside a value is escaped as `\|`; literal `\` as `\\`. This convention applies to CSV, GraphML, and GEXF since none of those formats has a native array type.
- **Missing values are backfilled with type defaults on load** (`0`, `""`, `false`, `[]`, `"1970-01-01"`). A blocking modal reports the total replacement count and lets you cancel.
- **Type inference**: types are detected from values per column/property. CSV columns can optionally declare a type via the header convention below; everything else infers from samples.

### JSON

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "1", "label": "Alice", "x": 10, "y": 20, "properties": { "age": 34, "active": true, "joined": "2021-03-15" } },
    { "id": "2", "label": "Bob" }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "source": "1", "target": "2", "label": "knows", "weight": 0.8 }
  ],
  "nodePropertiesMetadata": {
    "age": { "description": "Age in years" }
  }
}
```

- **Nodes**: `id` (required), `label` / `x` / `y` / `properties` (all optional).
- **Edges**: `source` / `target` (required), `label` / `weight` (optional).
- **`nodePropertiesMetadata`** (optional): maps property keys to `{ description }`. Descriptions appear as help popovers in the filter panels and node tooltip.

Full schema: `src/graph/lib/graphSchema.json`.

### CSV edge list (single file)

Drop a single `.csv` or `.tsv` with one edge per row:

```csv
source,target,weight,label
alice,bob,0.8,knows
bob,carol,1.2,follows
```

`source` and `target` are required; `weight` and `label` are optional. Column names are case-insensitive. Nodes are auto-derived from the union of source+target ids (no per-node properties — use the pair format for those). Extra columns are ignored. See `scripts/csv-to-graph.mjs` for a script that converts any CSV to JSON outside the app.

### CSV nodes + edges pair

Drop both files at once. Knotviz pairs them by filename (`*nodes*.csv` + `*edges*.csv`) regardless of the drop order.

`nodes.csv`:

```csv
id,label,x,y,age:number,joined:date,active:boolean,tags:string[]
n1,Alice,10,20,34,2021-03-15,true,engineer|founder
n2,Bob,-5,8,28,2023-11-02,false,designer
```

`edges.csv` — same shape as the edge-list format above.

**Typed column headers.** Any non-structural column can declare its type via a `name:type` suffix (recognised: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `date`, `string[]`). Headers without a suffix are inferred from sample values. `string[]` is never inferred — declare it explicitly so a legitimate string containing a pipe isn't misclassified as an array.

Structural columns (case-insensitive, no type suffix needed): `id` (required), `label`, `x`, `y`.

### GraphML

Standard GraphML with `<key>` declarations and `<data>` values:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns">
  <key id="lbl" for="node" attr.name="label" attr.type="string"/>
  <key id="age" for="node" attr.name="age"   attr.type="int"/>
  <key id="w"   for="edge" attr.name="weight" attr.type="double"/>
  <graph edgedefault="directed">
    <node id="n1"><data key="lbl">Alice</data><data key="age">34</data></node>
    <node id="n2"><data key="lbl">Bob</data></node>
    <edge source="n1" target="n2"><data key="w">0.8</data></edge>
  </graph>
</graphml>
```

Supported `attr.type`: `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `string`. Node keys named `label`, `x`, `y` map to structural fields; edge keys named `label` and `weight` map to `EdgeInput`. Other edge data is ignored. `<default>` fallbacks are honoured. yEd-specific extensions (`<y:Geometry>`, `<y:Fill>`), hyperedges, and nested graphs are out of scope.

### GEXF

GEXF 1.3 static graphs:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<gexf xmlns="http://gexf.net/1.3" version="1.3">
  <graph mode="static" defaultedgetype="directed">
    <attributes class="node">
      <attribute id="0" title="age" type="integer"/>
    </attributes>
    <nodes>
      <node id="n1" label="Alice">
        <attvalues><attvalue for="0" value="34"/></attvalues>
        <viz:position x="10" y="20" xmlns:viz="http://gexf.net/1.3/viz"/>
      </node>
      <node id="n2" label="Bob"/>
    </nodes>
    <edges>
      <edge source="n1" target="n2" weight="0.8"/>
    </edges>
  </graph>
</gexf>
```

Supported attribute `type`: `integer`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `string`, `anyURI`, `liststring` (decoded via the pipe-delimited convention). Element attributes on `<edge>` (`weight`, `label`) take priority over matching attvalues. `<viz:position>` maps to node x/y; z is ignored. Dynamic mode / `<spells>`, `viz:color`, `viz:size`, and `viz:shape` are out of scope.

### Analysis System
- **Color mode**: Color nodes by any property (number, string, boolean, date, string[])
  - 19 built-in palettes (Viridis, Plasma, Magma, Turbo, Blues, Grays, etc.)
  - Custom palette creation with arbitrary color stops
  - Palette reversal
  - Log scale toggle for numeric/date properties
  - Live legend (continuous gradient for numbers/dates, discrete chips for strings/booleans)
- **Size mode**: Scale node radius by property value
  - Area-proportional scaling (sqrt) so visual size matches value intuitively
  - Configurable min/max size range with editable inputs
- Statistics panel with percentiles (p25/p50/p75/p90), histogram, and sum for the selected property
- Analysis property shown on hover tooltip and highlighted in bold on click popover
- Gradient and size computation runs in Web Worker — no main-thread blocking

### Filtering System
- Per-property filters with type-specific UI:
  - **Number**: range slider with min/max text inputs, log scale toggle, histogram overlay
  - **String / String[]**: searchable multi-select with chip display
  - **Boolean**: true/false radio buttons
  - **Date**: range slider with ISO date display
- Multiple filters combine with AND logic
- Filtered-out nodes and their edges are fully hidden (not just dimmed)
- Match count shown in real-time (computed in Web Worker)
- Select all / Unselect all / Reset all controls
- Property descriptions from `nodePropertiesMetadata` shown as help popovers
- Filters work during simulation without interrupting it

### Search & Highlight
- **Substring search box** at the very top of the left sidebar — visible even before a graph is loaded (disabled in that state so the feature is discoverable). Matches against node `label` and `id` (case-insensitive)
- Matching nodes stay at full opacity; non-matching visible nodes dim to alpha 0.1 so structural context is preserved
- Edges with at least one matching endpoint stay visible; edges between two non-matching nodes are hidden (alpha 0)
- Zero-match queries show a "No matches" indicator and do not dim (so a stale/typoed query isn't mistaken for a broken view)
- Filter visibility wins: filter-hidden nodes never reappear via search. If a filter later hides some matches, the "X matches" count shrinks accordingly
- **Autocomplete dropdown** while typing shows up to 25 matching labels (click or Enter to narrow the highlight to that one node, Arrow keys to navigate, Escape or outside click to close). A footer indicates when more matches exist than fit in the sample (e.g. "Showing 25 of 12,340 matches")
- Long labels truncate with an ellipsis; the full text is available on hover via the `title` tooltip
- 150 ms input debounce — keystrokes feel instant because the input is locally controlled; only the committed query reaches the worker
- Source-agnostic primitive: the worker consumes a `highlighted: Uint8Array` bitmask regardless of origin, so future input sources (box-select, programmatic selection) reuse the same render path

### Position-Aware Loading
- If all nodes have `x`/`y` positions, they are preserved as-is
- If no nodes have positions, random positions are generated
- If some nodes have positions and others don't, all positions are randomized and a warning banner is shown

### Graph Export
- **Download** button exports the current graph with computed node positions
- Only visible nodes and edges are exported (respects active filters)
- Exported file can be re-imported to preserve the layout
- Round-trip: load -> simulate -> export -> re-import preserves positions

### Graph Info & Management
- Node and edge counts displayed in the sidebar (with filter-adjusted counts)
- Outgoing degree histogram
- Analysis and Filters panel toggles in the left sidebar for discoverability
- **Reset** button with confirmation dialog — clears graph and returns to drop zone
- Filename label shown on the canvas
- File replacement via drag-and-drop with confirmation dialog

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| Space | Start / stop simulation |
| Scroll | Zoom in / out |
| Click + Drag | Pan |
| Shift + Scroll | Rotate canvas |
| Escape | Close tooltip |
| Hover node | Show label + analysis property value |

### Error Handling
- Invalid JSON, missing required fields, empty graphs — all show user-friendly error messages
- Nodes missing `id` or edges referencing unknown nodes are skipped with console warnings
- WebGL failures caught by error boundary with fallback message
- Large file OOM detected with specific error message
- Loading progress shown for large files (Reading -> Parsing -> Processing nodes/edges -> Finalizing)
